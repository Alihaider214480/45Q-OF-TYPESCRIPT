bigger dinner table.

• Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite
 only two people for dinner.

• Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a
 name from your list, print
a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

• Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.

• Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you
 actually have an empty list at the end
of your program.*/

• Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its
order has changed.

• Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.

• Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.
